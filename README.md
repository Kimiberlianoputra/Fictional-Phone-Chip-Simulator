# 🌌 Prime Edition — Ultimate Fictional Phone Chip Simulator

Welcome to **Prime Edition**, an advanced, interactive simulator for designing and testing fictional mobile chips. This project blends hardware architecture, algorithmic modeling, and performance simulation into a playful, educational tool for tech enthusiasts, developers, and us phone concept maker.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is still in progress. I'm building it solo, fueled by memes, metaphysical rituals, and a deep love for chip design. If you're reading this and feel the urge to help—whether it's fixing bugs, optimizing code, or just vibing with the concept—please jump in. I need you. 🙏

## 🧠 What Is This?

**Prime Edition** is a web-based simulator that lets you:

- Architect your own fictional phone chip.
- Edit the core math algorithm that drives neural network simulations. **(doesnt work yet (many bug))**
- Explore how hardware and software interact—thermal throttling, DVFS, and more.
- Visualize performance, battery life, and thermal behavior.
- Save, load, compare, and export chip designs.

It’s part sandbox, part benchmark engine, part metaphysical playground.

## 👥 Who Is This For?

- **Tech enthusiasts & students** (maybe): Learn chip design principles and performance tradeoffs.
- **Developers & researchers**: Experiment with matrix math and neural workloads.
- **Gamers & creatives**: Understand how specs affect gaming and AI performance.
- **Me**: Design fantasy chips and explore real-world constraints.

## ⚙️ How It Works

At its core, the simulator runs matrix multiplications to mimic neural network layers. It:

- Times your custom algorithm. **(work-in-progress)**
- Counts floating-point and integer ops.
- Combines algorithm speed with chip specs.
- Simulates thermal effects, DVFS, and battery drain.
- Outputs performance metrics based on real-world constraints.

## 🌱 Why It Matters

- Bridges the gap between hardware specs and user experience.
- Highlights algorithm efficiency and memory alignment.
- Demonstrates thermal and power constraints in chip design.
- Encourages hands-on learning in a safe, interactive space.
- Allow a reason why my AnTuTu score is 3million on fictional chip contest
